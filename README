This is my first Rails application so please be nice to me :)

This is an application to take control over those lame protocols that companies in Brazil keep giving us at each call. In this application you should be able to:

* Keep track of protocols given by all companies you work with having:
    * Protocol number
    * Attendant's name
    * When the protocol were emmited (Date and Time)
    * Description field so you can keep track of what was agreed on
* Control Protocol's Statuses
    * Open
    * Closed
    * Follow Up (require furthuer action or completeness check)
* Setup a follow up date so you can be notified and take the appropriate action
* Add relationships to previously created protocols
